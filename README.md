# Pac-Man 3D with AI



## Overview
Pac-Man 3D with AI is an exciting game development project that brings the classic Pac-Man gameplay to a 3D environment. The game utilizes the powerful Behaviour Tree AI system to create engaging and dynamic gameplay experiences. In this project, players control Pac-Man, the iconic character, as they navigate through a maze filled with enemies exhibiting different states, such as "Running Away," "Chase," and "Idle."

## Enemy States
The enemies in the game can be in different states, which impact their behavior and interactions with the player. These states include:
- Running Away: Enemies flee from Pac-Man when he is empowered by a power pallet or a coin.
- Chase: Enemies actively pursue and try to capture Pac-Man when he is vulnerable.
- Idle: In this state, enemies idly patrol the maze, adding an element of unpredictability to their movements.

## Player Enemy States
As the player, Pac-Man can also be in different states that influence his interactions with the enemies. These states include:
- Attack: When Pac-Man is empowered by a power pallet or a coin, he can turn the tables and attack the enemies, making them run away.
- Running Away: When Pac-Man is not empowered, he needs to flee from enemies to avoid being caught.
- Finding Power Pallet or Coin: In this state, Pac-Man actively searches for power pallets or coins to become empowered.
